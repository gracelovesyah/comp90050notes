## Lecture 3: Database Management Systems

### Storage Area Networks (SAN)
- SANs are dedicated high-speed networks that provide access to consolidated block-level storage, primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, accessible to servers.

### Communication Costs
- Communication cost in a network can be calculated using the formula:

  $$
  \text{transmit time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{c} + \frac{\text{message bits}}{\text{bandwidth}}
  $$
  
  where $ c $ is the speed of light in fiber optics, approximately $ 200 $ million meters per second.

## Lecture 16: Optimistic Concurrency Control and Timestamping

### Optimistic Concurrency Control
